2) with ferret command as an arg:
$ ./pyferretWMS_edit.py 'shade/x=-180:180/y=-90:90/lev=20v/pal=mpl_PSU_inferno/title=Maximum temp[k=@max]; shade/x=-180:180/y=-90:90/lev=(-inf)(0,140,5)(inf)/pal=mpl_Seq1_RdPu/title=Temperature&nbspvariance temp[k=@var]; shade/x=-180:180/y=-90:90/lev=(-inf)(30,40,0.5)(inf)/pal=mpl_PSU_viridis/title=Surface&nbspsalinity salt[k=1]'

gunicorn notes
--------------
Example of a very small WSGI app loaded with a custom Application:
http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/custom.html

Customize flask response class:

bottle + gunicorn:
http://blog.yprez.com/running-a-bottle-app-with-gunicorn.html

Ars:
----
- Gunicorn is a server that can run applications. 
- PyferretWMS is an app, and your Flask thing is also an app.
- Here http://docs.gunicorn.org/en/stable/custom.html is what they do in their script to run their app. 
So what you need is to somehow wrap the logic of their StandaloneApp into your Flask application, and that logic goes like: 

handler_app is given to StandaloneApp and there is this load() function that returns it. So your focus should be probably on figuring out what's going on in handler_app (or just copy it as your Flask app, then you can extend).

gunicorn custom app tested in PROJECTS/sandbox/gunicorn/custom.py. To run it:
$ python custom.py
-> Then go to http://127.0.0.1:8080 in browser
-> See on the screen: "Works fine" (the return of handler_app)
