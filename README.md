This idea developped in this early prototype is to render variables read and computed from pyferret as slippy maps.
It is done directly from the memory without having to save them in netCDF files 
and expose them through a Thredds server to get the Web Map Service.

Here the tiles are generated by "workers" from a gunicorn server, a python WSGI HTTP server,
that use pyferret for the rendering. Thus you can use the same syntax as to display
your variables but here you get tiles to be rendered from a classic html + some javascript (with Leaflet.js calls),
or from an application that uses Chrome javascript engine and node.js (Node-Webkit.js).

Slippy maps avoid the command typing and display loops and hoppefully will help to gain time on analysis. 
Moreover considering that nowdays models are becoming incredibily refined with sometimes resolutions at 1/12°.
That makes the pan/zoom navigation even more useful.

Next steps:
- Use variables that are available from pyferret directly.
- Propose synchronous maps when 2 (or more) variables ares requested to allow direct spatial intercomparison.

Prerequisites:
- pyferret 7.0
- gunicorn
- nw.js

Examples of calls:
- ```./slippy_map.bash 'shade/lev=(-inf)(-10,30,1)(inf)/pal=mpl_PSU_viridis temp[k=@max]'```
- ```./slippy_map.bash 'shade/lev=(-inf)(30,40,1)(inf)/pal=mpl_PSU_inferno salt[k=1]'```
